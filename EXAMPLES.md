Have a look at [geojson file](examples/house.geojson) or [.osm file](examples/house.osm) to get examples.

Here is the basic rendenring:

![Alt text](examples/img/House_building.png?raw=true "Building view")
![Alt text](examples/img/House_floors.png?raw=true "Floors view")
![Alt text](examples/img/House_indoor.png?raw=true "Indoor view")
